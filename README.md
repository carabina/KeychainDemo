KeychainDemo
============

Demo project to show how to share a keychain between an App and it's extension in iOS8 using Swift

Keychain Access
---------------

The keychain access is implemented as a basic demo class within a framework.

**Don't use this class outside of this demo. It's meant only for demo puposes. There is no error handling, for example.**

Today Extension
---------------

In this demo a today extension is used to show that the keychain is shared between the App and it's extension. This should also work with share extensions.
